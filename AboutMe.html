											<h1>Hi.</h1>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Aleksi Heikkinen. I am currently a student at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences where I study information and communication technology, ICT. My major in school is Game Development.</p>
										<p>I have always had a passion with computers and video games, so what's better than to start studying it. I have around 5 years of experience in coding which most of it being basic coding. Now I am trying to learn more 
											languages and different styles of known laguages. I enjoy challenging myself with new even if I may fail horribly or not.
										</p>
										<p>I also have been in scouts for atleast a decade. I have really enjoyed it there, I have managed to learn major skills in life. I've been in our scout groups govenrment for two years now. 
											Addittionally I have been helping out in redesigning our website so it would look more "nykyaika".</p>
											<p>I have also joined in Spring 2024 our schools government board as an alternate member to help out.</p>
